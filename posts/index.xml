            <description>I&amp;rsquo;m starting this site to encourage myself to reflect and think through things more deeply, something I think is important in a world that gravitates towards sound bites and reductionism. There&amp;rsquo;ll be posts on my interests, current events, books I&amp;rsquo;ve read, life experiences, and questions I find interesting.
It&amp;rsquo;ll also be a record of sorts for myself. Past photos and videos are great for reliving highs and lows, but don&amp;rsquo;t quite capture our thoughts at a particular moment in time in high resolution.</description>

There&rsquo;ll be posts on my interests, current events, books I&rsquo;ve read, life experiences, and <a href="https://justinchan.one/questions/">questions I find interesting</a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll also be a record of sorts for myself. Past photos and videos are great for reliving highs and lows, but don&rsquo;t quite capture our thoughts at a particular moment in time in high resolution.</p>
<p>Somewhat selfishly, in the future I&rsquo;m hoping I can just share a link to a post instead of re-explaining things and having to deal with the lossiness of my own memory, but we&rsquo;ll see if we get there.</p>
