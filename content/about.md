I'm currently a software engineer at Lyft, working on making the platform safer between users.

I'll be writing about things that interest me. Broadly speaking, that includes tech, software, economics, sports and sociology. Another way to frame my interests are [these questions]({{< ref "questions.md" >}}). 

In my free time, I enjoy reading, listening to music, and all things sports (badminton, soccer and more recently, running). I like figuring out, reasoning about, building and improving systems.
