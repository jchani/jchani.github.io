I'm starting this site to encourage myself to reflect and think through things more deeply, something I think is important in a world that tends towards sound bites and reductionism. There'll be posts on my interests, current events, books I've read, life experiences, and [questions I find interesting]({{< ref "questions.md" >}}). 

It'll also be a record of sorts for myself. Past photos and videos are great for reliving highs and lows, but don't quite capture our thoughts at a particular moment in time in high resolution. 

Somewhat selfishly, in the future I'm hoping I can just share a link to a post instead of re-explaining things and having to deal with the lossiness of my own memory, but we'll see if we get there.
