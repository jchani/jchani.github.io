Here's a list of questions that I like reading about and discussing. I'm a novice in almost all of these subjects, so any opinions or suggestions on relevant reading would be appreciated. 


Technology
- How can we mitigate bias in predictive systems that rely on algorithms or models that are based off of historical data, especially those in fields with material consequences like credit, criminal justice, university admissions, and hiring? 

- Is it only a matter of time before software engineering becomes commoditized? Or will the rate of change in the field, potential for scalable impact, and demand for talent outpace the increasing supply of talent? Or does the arms race in product/infra development among unicorns and public companies ensure that this will remain a lucrative career path? 


Economic

- Is it possible for the stock market to be consistently insulated from financial crisis assuming perfect information, analysis and response from the central bank and government (and those of other countries)? 

- To what extent do market movements tend towards the "random walk" hypothesis or follow predictable trends? 



Social

- Why are people in some countries on average so much happier (self-reported) than those in others?

- What has taken the void left by religion in our increasingly secular society? 

- How do we reconcile environmentalism with development since it's often a direct trade-off? 

- How do we bridge the gap in a increasingly divided country?

- Punishments are so much more lenient for white collar crime than for traditional crime. What does a justice system that optimizes for fairness and rehabilitation look like?
